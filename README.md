Texture Synthesis
=================

Tools for synthesizing sprites

Python Pillow
---------------

These are simple scripts to be used with the [pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.org/) python module.


Gimp PythonFu
---------------

These are simple plugins that can be used with the [gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) image editing program.
To install the scripts drop the plugin into the gimp plugin folder.
This is usually found at `/user/<username>/.gimp/plug-ins/`

For the included normal map scripts to work, the normalmap plugin is required as a *dependency*.
Please download it [here](https://code.google.com/p/gimp-normalmap/), and follow the instructions in its respective readme.
